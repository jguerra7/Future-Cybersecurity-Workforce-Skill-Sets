# Future-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Skill-Sets
Focus on hiring talent with the following security skills and your team will be equipped to prevent, protect and mitigate the damage of cybersecurity attacks — and speed recovery efforts.

The cyber threat landscape continues to expand with no signs of slowing. With ever-evolving sophistication and an increasing number of cyberattacks happening every day, 
one might expect to see growth in the cybersecurity job market to boost our defenses. 
Unfortunately, the reality is just the opposite. 
We’re faced with a widening skills gap in the cyber industry, putting us at greater risk than ever because we don’t have enough people to mitigate, defend and analyze incoming attacks and vulnerabilities. 
According to recent estimates, we are looking at the possibility of having as many as 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions by 2021.
