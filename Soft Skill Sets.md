# The “soft skills” for cyber security careers:
 
##  You’re a Leader
Security experts show leadership through their credibility, responsiveness, and ethics. A security expert earns trust from senior management, peers, and subordinates with excellent communication skills. An important skill to have is to understand the risks of the business, internally and externally. Security leaders provide actionable insights to their leadership and help this team make informed decisions.

##  You’re Passionate About Learning
Security experts are continually learning the latest trends, technologies, and security challenges within the business environment. You have to be passionate about learning and professional growth to be successful. Security is one of the most fast-paced segments in IT and requires someone with an insatiable appetite for knowledge and expertise.


## You’re Determined
Cyber security practitioners have to be persistent with an ever-changing threat landscape but also handle very difficult jobs to start. Persistence is key. A cyber security expert sees a solution through to completion and doesn’t stop until the challenge is solved.

## You’re Collaborative
Cyber security is a shared responsibility across the organization. Therefore, all-star cyber security practitioners are collaborative and work at all levels of the organization to instill a culture of cybersecurity. They make sure security policies are not only in place but followed. It’s critical as a security leader to gain buy-in throughout the organization for your security initiatives as well. They can often be pushed to the side until it’s too late and a major breach has occurred.

## You’re Analytical, Inquisitive and Insightful
A skilled cyber security practitioner is analytical regarding an understanding how incidents occur, the attack surfaces prone to exploitation, and how to minimize cyber attacks. This particular skill set can take years to develop and even includes a little intuition on the part of the practitioner.

## You Can Think Hyper Critically
An analytical and insightful security practitioner anticipates how hackers will exploit the network and its applications. In a way, the cyber security expert thinks like a hacker or “Black Hat” and identifies the vulnerabilities ahead of time.

##  You’re Consultative
As a cyber security expert, you have to interface with the IT department, the C-level, and end users. It’s important that you see the big picture and ask the right questions at all levels of the organization. It’s also important that you work with the broader business goals in mind and deploy your security plans with key performance indicators (KPIs) in mind.

## You’re a Project Manager
As a cyber security leader, you will need to put together comprehensive security solutions to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber attacks. Rather than thinking of installing a solution as “one-and-done,” you need to think of them more holistically, building a complete “Defense-in-Depth” security strategy that aligns to all the resources of the organization.
